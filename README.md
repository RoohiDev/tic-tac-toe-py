# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a classic CLI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python.
I plan to expand this project as much as I can over time.

## A Brief History of Tic-Tac-Toe
**Ancient Origins (c. 1300 BC):**
The earliest known three-in-a-row boards have been found in **ancient Egypt**, carved into roofing tiles dating back to around 1300 BC — making the game over 3,000 years old.
**Roman Empire (1st century BC):**
An early variation called ***terni lapilli*** ("three pebbles at a time") was played throughout the Roman Empire. Unlike modern Tic-Tac-Toe, each player had only three pieces. After placing them, players took turns moving their pebbles to empty spaces. Evidence of the game has been found chalked on surfaces all over Rome.

## How to play
**The Board:** A 3×3 grid with 9 empty spaces.

**Players:** Two players — one uses X, the other uses O. X usually goes first.

**Objective:** Be the first to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

### Gameplay:

1. Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty space

2. The game continues until:

    - A player gets three in a row → they win! 🏆

    - All 9 spaces are filled with no winner → it's a draw 🤝

>**Strategy Note:** When both players play perfectly, the game will always end in a draw.
